# Start Your AI Agent Development Journey

Welcome to the **AI Agents Plugin**! This interactive guide helps you master AI agent development with production-grade patterns from LangChain, Anthropic, and OpenAI.

## Choose Your Learning Path

### 1. Agent Fundamentals
Master the core concepts of AI agent systems.

**Topics covered:**
- ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) pattern
- Plan-and-Execute architecture
- Cognitive loops and decision making
- Single vs multi-agent systems

**Skills you'll learn:**
- Design agent architectures
- Implement ReAct agents
- Add circuit breakers and error handling
- Build autonomous task solvers

**Get started:**
```
"Help me understand how ReAct agents work"
"Build a simple agent with LangGraph"
"What's the difference between ReAct and Plan-and-Execute?"
```

---

### 2. LLM Integration
Connect and optimize Large Language Models for your agents.

**Topics covered:**
- Anthropic Claude API (Messages, Tool Use)
- OpenAI API (Chat Completions, Functions)
- Prompt engineering and templates
- Cost optimization strategies

**Skills you'll learn:**
- Integrate multiple LLM providers
- Design effective system prompts
- Implement streaming responses
- Reduce API costs by 40-60%

**Get started:**
```
"Show me how to use Claude with tool calling"
"Design a chain-of-thought prompt template"
"How do I implement retry with exponential backoff?"
```

---

### 3. RAG Systems
Build Retrieval-Augmented Generation for grounded responses.

**Topics covered:**
- Embedding models and vector stores
- Chunking strategies (semantic, recursive)
- Hybrid search (dense + sparse)
- Reranking and evaluation

**Skills you'll learn:**
- Design RAG pipelines
- Choose optimal chunking strategies
- Implement hybrid search
- Evaluate with RAGAS metrics

**Get started:**
```
"Build a RAG system with Pinecone"

"How do I implement reranking?"
```

---

### 4. Tool Calling
Enable LLMs to interact with external systems.

**Topics covered:**
- Claude Tool Use
- OpenAI Function Calling (with strict mode)
- JSON Schema design
- Error handling and validation

**Skills you'll learn:**
- Design tool schemas
- Implement tool loops
- Handle execution errors
- Orchestrate sequential/parallel tools

**Get started:**
```
"Create a tool for database search"
"How does OpenAI strict mode work?"
"Best practices for tool descriptions"
```

---

### 5. Multi-Agent Systems
Build coordinated systems of specialized agents.

**Topics covered:**
- Orchestrator-Worker pattern
- Hierarchical architectures
- Agent communication
- LangGraph multi-agent

**Skills you'll learn:**

```

---

### 7. Agent Safety
Ensure responsible AI agent deployment.

**Topics covered:**
- Input/output guardrails
- Prompt injection defense
- Content filtering
- Rate limiting and compliance

**Skills you'll learn:**
- Implement safety guardrails
- Detect and prevent attacks
