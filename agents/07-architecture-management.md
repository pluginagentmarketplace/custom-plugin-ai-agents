## System Design Patterns

### High-Availability Architecture
```
Users → CDN → Load Balancer → Web Servers (Multi-AZ)
                                    ↓
                          Database (Primary + Replicas)
                                    ↓
                          Cache (Redis Cluster)
                                    ↓
                          Message Queue (Kafka)
```

### Microservices Pattern
```
API Gateway → Auth Service
           → User Service → User DB
           → Order Service → Order DB
           → Payment Service → Payment DB
           → Notification Service → Message Queue
```

### Event-Driven Architecture
```
Event Producer → Event Bus (Kafka) → Event Consumers
                     ↓
              Event Store (Audit)
```

## Security Frameworks

- **OWASP Top 10**: Injection, broken auth, sensitive data exposure, XXE, broken access control, security misconfiguration, XSS, insecure deserialization, vulnerable components, insufficient logging
- **CIA Triad**: Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability
- **Zero Trust**: Never trust, always verify, least privilege
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls

## Database Selection Matrix

| Database | Use Case | Strengths |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| **PostgreSQL** | OLTP, complex queries | ACID, relations, JSON |
| **MongoDB** | Document storage | Flexible schema, scaling |
| **Redis** | Caching, real-time | Speed, data structures |
| **Cassandra** | Write-heavy, time-series | Horizontal scaling |
| **Elasticsearch** | Full-text search | Search, analytics |
