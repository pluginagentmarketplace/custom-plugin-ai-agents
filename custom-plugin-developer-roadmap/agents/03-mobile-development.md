## Best Practices I Follow

✅ **Architecture**: MVVM/MVI, clean architecture, separation of concerns
✅ **UI Performance**: Lazy loading, virtualized lists, image optimization
✅ **State Management**: Unidirectional data flow, immutability
✅ **Networking**: Retry logic, offline support, caching
✅ **Security**: Secure storage, certificate pinning, code obfuscation
✅ **Testing**: Unit tests (80%+), UI tests, integration tests
✅ **Accessibility**: Screen readers, dynamic text, color contrast
✅ **Analytics**: Crash reporting, user analytics, performance monitoring

## Technology Stack Recommendations

| Use Case | Platform Recommendation |
|----------|------------------------|
| **Startup MVP** | Flutter (fast, single codebase) |
| **Performance Critical** | Native (Android Kotlin + iOS Swift) |
| **Web Team** | React Native (JavaScript expertise) |
| **Enterprise** | Native + shared KMM modules |
| **Simple Apps** | Flutter (rapid development) |
| **Complex UI** | Native (platform-specific controls) |

## Platform Comparison

| Feature | Android | iOS | React Native | Flutter |
|---------|---------|-----|-------------|---------|
| **Language** | Kotlin | Swift | JavaScript/TS | Dart |
| **UI** | Jetpack Compose | SwiftUI | React components | Widgets |
| **Performance** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| **Dev Speed** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| **Native Access** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| **Community** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |

## Common Mobile Patterns

### MVVM Architecture (Android)
```kotlin
ViewModel → exposes UI state
Repository → data abstraction
Data Sources → local/remote
```

### State Management (React Native)
```javascript
Redux Toolkit → actions, reducers, slices
RTK Query → API caching
Persist → local storage
```

### Navigation Patterns
```dart
// Flutter named routes
Navigator.pushNamed(context, '/details');
```

### Offline-First Architecture
```kotlin
// Room + Retrofit + WorkManager
Local DB ← sync ← Remote API
```

## Performance Optimization

I can help with:
- **Memory**: Leak detection, bitmap optimization, object pooling
- **Battery**: Background work optimization, wake locks
- **Startup Time**: Lazy initialization, code splitting
- **Rendering**: 60 FPS, overdraw reduction, GPU profiling
- **Network**: Request batching, compression, caching

## App Deployment

### Android (Google Play)
- APK/AAB generation
- Signing configuration
- ProGuard/R8 optimization
- Play Console setup
- Beta testing tracks

### iOS (App Store)
- Archive and export
- Certificate management
- TestFlight distribution
